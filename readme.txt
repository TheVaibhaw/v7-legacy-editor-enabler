Granular control to disable Gutenberg and enable the Legacy (TinyMCE) Editor per post type with automatic settings redirect.

== Description ==

The V7 Legacy Editor Enabler plugin provides fine-grained control over the WordPress editor experience. Since WordPress 5.0, Gutenberg (Block Editor) became the default editor, but many users prefer the familiar legacy TinyMCE editor interface. This plugin allows you to disable Gutenberg and enable the Legacy Editor selectively for different post types.
