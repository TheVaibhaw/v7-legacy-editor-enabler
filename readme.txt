A professional WordPress plugin that disables the Gutenberg block editor and enables the Classic Editor for Posts and Pages with granular control.

== Description ==

The V7 Classic Editor Enabler plugin provides fine-grained control over the WordPress editor experience. Since WordPress 5.0, Gutenberg (Block Editor) became the default editor, but many users prefer the familiar Classic Editor interface. This plugin allows you to disable Gutenberg and enable the Classic Editor selectively for different post types.

= Key Features =

* **Selective Enablement**: Choose which post types use Classic Editor (Posts, Pages, or both)
* **Automatic Redirect**: Redirects to settings page immediately after activation for easy configuration
* **User-Friendly Settings**: Simple checkbox interface under Settings menu
* **Post-Type Specific**: Control editor per post type independently
* **Professional Code**: Built with WordPress best practices and security standards
* **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on site performance

= How It Works =

* **Posts**: Enable/disable Classic Editor for blog posts
* **Pages**: Enable/disable Classic Editor for static pages
* **Flexible Control**: Mix and match - use Classic for posts but Gutenberg for pages, or vice versa
